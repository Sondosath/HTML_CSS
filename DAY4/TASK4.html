         <br>

            can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the <mark class="sec_word">beginning</mark>  of the day.
            The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity 
            to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as
            the first one of a <mark class="First_word">short</mark>  story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph
            somewhere in a <mark class="First_word">short</mark> story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending 
            paragraph in a <mark class="First_word">short</mark> story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use
            creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
